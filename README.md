## Abstract: 

Omeka is a free Content Management System (CMS) and a web publishing system built by and for scholars that is used by hundreds of archives, historical societies, libraries, museums, and individual researchers and teachers to create searchable online databases and scholarly online interpretations of their digital collections. Omeka allows to describe the items according to archival standards, import and export that descriptive information from other systems, and to create as many interpretive online exhibits as you like from those items.

This workshop offers different possibilities to use Omeka in the classroom, with a focus on its pedagogical and public-facing capacities.

## Requirements
- Some familiarity with Omeka is recommended but not required.

## Notes

This workshop can be both taught as stand-alone or as a follow up to the [Introduction to Omeka](https://github.com/smorello87/intro-to-omeka). The workshop takes approximately ninety minutes to complete.
