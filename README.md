# Teaching with Omeka

This is a workshop that can be both taught as a stand-alone workshop or as a follow up to the Intro to Omeka workshop. It can also be taught, with a bit of a twist, as a generic workshop on using digital archives in the classroom.

## Credits
This workshop was written by [Stefano Morello](https://github.com/smorello87).

## Workshops
It was first taught at CUNY GC by Stefano Morello in the Spring of 2020 as a two hour online syncronous workshop.

Abstract: 

Omeka is a free Content Management System (CMS) and a web publishing system built by and for scholars that is used by hundreds of archives, historical societies, libraries, museums, and individual researchers and teachers to create searchable online databases and scholarly online interpretations of their digital collections. Omeka allows to describe the items according to archival standards, import and export that descriptive information from other systems, and to create as many interpretive online exhibits as you like from those items.

>Through this workshop, we are going to explore different ways to use Omeka in the classroom, with a focus on its pedagogical and public-facing capacities.

## Requirements
- Students need to be familiar with Omeka. They can refer to the GCDI Intro to Omeka workshop.

## Reception and Feedback
I only taught this workshop remotely, feedback was good. 

## Needed/Desired Changes 
It can certainly be expanded, perhaps by showing 1-2 case studies, or by co-teaching with guest instructors willing to share their experience with the participants. Also, it is considerably less hands-on than most GCDI workshops; we can certainly improve this workshop on that front.
